# compare sorting algorithms

- implement parseData function
- implement selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort and heap sort algorithms in the corresponding functions respectively.

Student:
    heapsort signature has 2 arguments while function call has three
    removed second argument in function call
    added heapify function
    added string.h library for memcpy function to work
